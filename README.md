*The primary transitions/ions analyzed are Si II (1193), Si III (1206.5), and Si IV (1393). The additional ions all hold their resultant co-added spectra in the folders
but no accompanying analyses.

For lambda = 1193,1206,1393:
  Coadds:53 resultant spectra loosely within the folder. The corresponding subfolders labeled "Patch x" show the normalized individual QSO sightlines that make up each 
  coadd.
  Individual SNR Data: contains histogram of distribution of the s/N of targets utilized (or not) from HSLA archival data.
  Final: seperated into- inflow | outflow
      Inflow\Outflow: Vgsr/logN allsky plot loose in both inflow/outflow folders
                      subfolders are now seperated by the distance of the gas shell (5,10,12,15 kpc)
                        
                                for each distance: An allsky map of the flux flow rates per region analyzed 
                                **NOTE: These flux flow rate plots have been optimized for 12 kpc, where the data/colorbar offers the largest dynamic range
                                
                                Also in distance subfolders are Mdot Vs lat/long figures
                                
Mass Flow Combined: contains the total/final inflow|outflow|netflow results, Solid Angle figure, patch identification figure, and comparison to individual results
